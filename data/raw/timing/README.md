# Replication timing track (Repli-seq): `repliSeq_SknshWaveSignalRep1.bigWig`

This directory contains a replication timing signal track for the **SK-N-SH** human cell line, produced using the **Repli-seq** assay (UW Repli-seq / ENCODE track on UCSC).

## File

- **Local filename:** `repliSeq_SknshWaveSignalRep1.bigWig`
- **Cell line:** SK-N-SH
- **View type:** Wavelet-smoothed Signal (Replicate 1)
- **Genome assembly / coordinates:** **hg19 (GRCh37)**
- **Original UCSC table name:** `wgEncodeUwRepliSeqSknshWaveSignalRep1`

## What this signal means

Replication timing is represented as a single continuous signal summarising six cell-cycle fractions, where **higher values correspond to earlier replication**. The UCSC track describes this as a **wavelet-smoothed transform** of the fraction profile.
